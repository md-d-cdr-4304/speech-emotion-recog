# Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) System

This project focuses on building a **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system** that detects emotions like happiness, sadness, and anger from speech signals. Using **MFCCs** for feature extraction and machine learning models such as **SVM**, **RNN**, and **CNN**, the system classifies emotions from audio data.

- **Feature Extraction**: Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)
- **Models**: SVM, RNN, CNN for emotion classification
- **Dataset**: RAVDESS emotional speech recordings

Applications include enhancing customer service, virtual assistants, and emotion-based therapeutic tools.
